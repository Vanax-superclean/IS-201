                        <p>Okay, so you're probably wondering when I'll have all those beautiful pieces ready to go, right? Well, getting properly set up for silversmithing, goldsmithing, and even setting stones takes a bit of time to gather all the right gear.</p>
                        <p>Think about it – I'll need a good jeweler's saw and a whole collection of blades just for cutting the metal precisely. Then there's needing a solid anvil or steel block and the right kind of hammers to shape everything. Plus, all those different pliers for bending and working with the little components – you need a pretty sizable toolkit, just for the basics!</p>
                        <p>And when it comes to actually putting pieces together, that involves soldering, which means getting a torch, a safe surface to work on (soldering block), and all the right flux and solder. After that, it's a lot of refining with various files, and a bench pin to hold things steady. Of course, I need to be accurate, so calipers and a ruler are a must.</p>
                        <p>Now, if I want to set stones, that's a whole other level of tools! I'll need specialized bezel pushers and prong pushers to carefully secure each gem, as well as a burnisher to make everything look smooth and professional. To even work on these tiny pieces, I'll need things like a ring clamp to hold them steady. Depending on the setting, I might even need tiny setting burrs and a graver for extra detail. Honestly, just seeing the tiny details requires good magnification like a loupe or an Optivisor.</p>
                        <p>So, as you can see, it's not just a case of snapping my fingers and having a workshop ready. Gathering all these specialized tools takes time and careful selection to make sure I have everything I need to create high-quality pieces that I'll be proud to share with you. I want to do it right, so please bear with me while I build up my toolkit! Luckily, I already have most of the basic tools necessary to get started left over from my previous venture, so most of what I need is for more advanced stone setting. However, there is one big caveat I need to address first.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">You can't just light things on fire inside of a dorm room</h2>
                        <p>Okay, so you're probably picturing me already hammering away and setting stones, right? Well, there's a bit of a hurdle when it comes to the actual making process, and it's all about finding the right workspace. You see, things like soldering, which is essential for joining metal in jewelry, involve using a torch. And unfortunately, open flames and dorm rooms definitely don't mix – for obvious safety reasons!</p>
                        <p>So, before I can even think about gathering all the tools I’ll need like the saw, hammers, pliers, and files, I first need to figure out a safe and suitable space to actually use the torch and do the soldering. That means scouting out a studio space, maybe looking into shared workshops, or even figuring out if I can set up a proper ventilated area somewhere else off-campus.</p>
                        <p>Finding the right kind of workspace that allows for the use of a torch is the crucial first step. It's not as simple as just setting up a table in my dorm room, unfortunately! So, please be patient with me as I navigate finding a safe and appropriate studio before I can really dive into creating those pieces you're envisioning. It's a necessary step to make sure everything is done safely and to a high standard. Luckily, I have a trick up my sleeve that might help me to get started a bit early.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Enter Castimize</h2>
                        <p>While waiting on a space that I can operate a flame in, there is something I can do in the meantime to bring designs to life. There are various companies out there to whom you can send a 3d model to and get back a casting in the material of your choice, a perfect physical copy of your digital design. I am currently planning on using Castimize to help with the fabrication process for making jewelry, after which I can clean up, polish, and perform some basic stone settings. Obviously, I will be limited in exactly how much I can do, but being able to collaborate with another company will allow me to get started faster as well as get basic parts I need in a timely manner in the future.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/castimize_dragon.jpg" alt="..." /></a>

                        <p>The first step, though, is getting really comfortable with 3D modeling itself. I'm still in the process of learning the ropes and honing my skills in creating those digital designs. But the exciting part is that I should be far enough along to actually start playing around with Castimize and getting some of my digital creations cast into metal once the upcoming fall semester rolls around – likely sometime in October. That's when I'm hoping to finally see my digital visions take physical form, ready to be finished and shared! It's a different path, but it opens up so many possibilities without the immediate need for a torch in my current situation.</p>
