                        <p>My name is Jeremy Tolbert, and I've been designing jewelry for 5 years. I was born in Utah, but have also lived in 
                            Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, and North Carolina. I spent 2 years abroad living in Japan, where I learned a lot
                            about the culture, people, and art. I got into jewelry design while I was still in high school, and ended up buying 
                            my own setup to manufacture the pieces I was imagining. Since then, I've explored different styles, materials, and 
                            have learned a lot about the history of jewelry across different cultures and continents. I'm excited to share my 
                            vision of creating meaningful jewelry that feels perfect at a low cost!

                        <h2>What Motivates Me?</h2>
                        <p>A quiet ache settles in my chest each time I see the flimsy clasps and dull stones that so often adorn the fingers 
                            and necks of those I pass. It’s a subtle sadness, a whisper of what could be, knowing these pieces, meant to be 
                            cherished daily companions, are often born of hurried hands and cost-cutting measures. This quiet sorrow fuels 
                            a fierce ember within me, a yearning to sculpt something better, something worthy of the stories and moments 
                            they will witness. My hands long to shape not just metal and gems, but enduring artistry, tiny sparks of joy 
                            and beauty meant to flicker brightly against the skin, a tangible rebellion against the mundane, whispering of 
                            care and intention with every gleam. Nobody wants to wear a wedding ring of poor craftsmanship, to hand down an
                        heirloom to their children that they know was mass produced, or to give a gift to a friend that has a chance of breaking
                    due to flimsy construction. I aim to solve these problems by creating beautiful jewelry that lasts for as long as the earth 
                took to create the stones used in the first place.</p>                    </div>
